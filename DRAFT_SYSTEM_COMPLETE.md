# Draft System Upgrade - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

The draft system has been completely overhauled with broadcast-quality animations, real-time polling, and seamless integration between the admin panel, draft room, and overlay.

---

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### Phase 1: System Audit & Cleanup
- **Removed 20+ legacy files** with broken dependencies
- **Deleted duplicate team data** - now uses unified constants
- **Removed framer-motion** - standardized on GSAP only
- **Cleaned up directory**: 30+ files → 2 clean, working files

### Phase 2: Animation Integration  
- **Dynamic polling**: 1s during LIVE, 5s when PAUSED, 10s when COMPLETED
- **Broadcast-quality pick animation**: Full 11-second GSAP sequence
  - Team intro with logo/colors (2s)
  - Transition wipe effect (0.6s)
  - Draft card reveal (1.5s)
  - Player card display (2s)
  - Hold for viewing (2s)
  - Professional exit (1s)
- **Enhanced draft board**: New picks animate in with gold flash and smooth transitions
- **Clock animations**: Pulses red when under 10 seconds

### Phase 4: Dynamic Year Configuration
- Draft year automatically pulled from database
- No hardcoded dates in animations
- Works for any season

### Phase 5: Draft Room Integration
- **Fixed broken imports** from deleted files
- **Tabbed interface**: Switch between "Draft Room" and "Broadcast View"
- Users can see live overlay while making picks
- Mobile-responsive design
- Turn notifications with audio alert

## 📝 Year-to-Year Setup

### Before Each Season

1. **Update Draft Date**
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/constants/league.ts
   IMPORTANT_DATES.NEXT_DRAFT = new Date('2027-07-XX...')
   ```

2. **Create New Draft**
   - Go to `/admin/draft`
   - Click "Create Draft"
   - Enter new year (e.g., 2027)
   - System handles everything else automatically

3. **Optional: Custom Player Pool**
   - Upload CSV/JSON with player list
   - Format: id, name, position, nfl_team, rank
   - Or use Sleeper API data (default)

### No Code Changes Required!
- Year dynamically pulled from database
- Team data unified in constants
- Animations adapt automatically

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Draft not starting
- Check database connection
- Ensure draft table exists (`ensureDraftTables()`)
- Verify team names match constants

### Overlay not updating
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `/api/draft` returns data
- Check polling interval (should be 1-5s)

### Animations not playing
- Ensure GSAP is loaded
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `DraftPickAnimation` component mounted

### Team authentication issues
- Check `/api/auth/me` returns team claim
- Verify JWT token valid
- Ensure team name matches `TEAM_NAMES` constant
