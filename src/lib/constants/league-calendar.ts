/**
 * Year-aware league calendar for the League countdown resolver.
 *
 * Each entry covers exactly one league year. The resolver selects the calendar
 * whose leagueYearStart ≤ now and uses its dates to determine the current phase
 * and two-card countdown targets.
 *
 * Confirmed dates: sourced from official NFL / league announcements.
 * Estimated dates: best-estimate placeholders based on NFL scheduling patterns.
 * Entries in `estimatedFields` are estimates — update them when official dates
 * are released; do not rely on them for precision timing.
 *
 * To add a new season, append an entry to LEAGUE_CALENDARS. No changes are
 * needed in countdown-resolver.ts.
