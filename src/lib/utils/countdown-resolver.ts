/**
 * Six-stage countdown resolver for the League homepage.
 *
 * Always returns exactly two CountdownCard objects representing the two most
 * relevant upcoming events for the current moment in the league calendar.
 *
 * Stages per cycle (each stage runs between two consecutive calendar events):
 *   1. leagueYearStart → rookieDraft         → [rookieDraft, regularSeasonStart]
 *   2. rookieDraft → faBiddingStart           → [faBiddingStart, regularSeasonStart]
 *   3. faBiddingStart → regularSeasonStart    → [regularSeasonStart, tradeDeadline]
 *   4. regularSeasonStart → tradeDeadline     → [tradeDeadline, postseasonStart]
 *   5. tradeDeadline → postseasonStart        → [postseasonStart, nextLeagueYearStart]
 *   6. postseasonStart → nextLeagueYearStart  → [nextLeagueYearStart, nextCycle.rookieDraft]
 *
 * At nextLeagueYearStart the next calendar cycle begins at Stage 1.
 *
 * Calendar data lives in LEAGUE_CALENDARS (league-calendar.ts).
 * To add a new season, append an entry there — no changes needed here.
 *
 * Invariants guaranteed:
 *   - Exactly two cards are always returned.
 *   - Every returned targetDate is strictly later than `now`.
 *   - Expired events from prior cycles are never shown.
