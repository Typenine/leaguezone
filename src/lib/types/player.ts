/**
 * Shared types for the canonical League player profile system.
 *
 * These types deliberately separate two distinct statistical systems:
 *  - NFL fantasy production (`PlayerNFLSeasonStat`): a player's real-world NFL production
 *    scored under League league rules, independent of who owned the player.
 *  - League franchise-attributed production (`PlayerWeeklyHistoryEntry` and everything
 *    built from it): only the points actually scored while a specific EVW franchise owned
 *    the player, derived from weekly Sleeper matchup `players_points`.
 *
 * Do not conflate the two — see PlayerProfileService for how each is computed.
